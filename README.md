# About me
🙋‍♂️ Charles/Chase West 15 yr old. Contact me at chasewestbusiness@gmail.com

👨‍🎓 I'm currently pursuing a CIT degree from community college
while in high school. I plan to go to college and study Computer Science. 

💻 I've technically been coding since I was 12 but
I got more serious when I was 14. 

🏋️ Outside of coding a great passion of mine is weightlifting
and I hope to incorporate it into more projects soon.

🏆 My best project is my recipes app for weightlifting.
It helped me develop really important skills in SQL and python. 

📚 Currently taking a web development class.
